            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Miami Underwater</h1><p>The city of Miami Beach floods on such a predictable basis that if, out of curiosity or sheer perversity, a person wants to she can plan a visit to coincide with an inundation. Knowing the tides would be high around the time of the "super blood moon," in late September, I arranged to meet up with Hal Wanless, the chairman of the University of Miami's geological-sciences department.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d4bf2f31f4e398ac29fb74f9637e7373449938b7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Pre-Fab "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" - The New Yorker</h1><p>For better and worse, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" is a work of directorial authorship. J. J. Abrams has long been channelling the spirit of Steven Spielberg, and here he splices the Spielbergian gene into George Lucas's mythology. That's not an inherently bad thing-if it's done by Steven Spielberg.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3f72e3978dfee7fabc9d6f42c69bfa3f6d2a9646.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A complete guide to the new Star Wars canon before The Force Awakens</h1><p>When Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company threw almost every piece of Star Wars lore away. In a flash, literally decades of stories from its expanded universe were nixed from canon - cleaning the slate in order to give director J. J. Abrams freedom to tell a new tale starting moments after Return of the Jedi ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5151875b8afa585ecb381de99dfe3a980b6473bd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Airbus And Qatar Airways Debut A Carbon Fiber Plane That Curbs Jet Lag</h1><p>From labyrinthine security checkpoints to cramped seats and scant overhead storage space, air travel ranks among the most grueling experiences out there (unless you're one of the rarefied few who spring for first class). With its A350 XWB jet, Airbus integrates the latest design and engineering tricks to quell many of the headaches for flyers, carriers, and pilots.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/74ee40415a2824c51ba7c63155269b174fcca7d7.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Fed just raised rates for the first time since 2006</h1><p>An almost biblical seven-year stretch of near zero interest rates effectively ended Wednesday when the Federal Reserve announced that it would increase its benchmark monetary policy rate a quarter of a percent. The decision came exactly seven years after the Fed cut the target for its benchmark Fed funds rate to near zero on Dec.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cde6b9aed2f5384f521c3b3a01c3af4baa870a02.jpg"></article>]]></description>
