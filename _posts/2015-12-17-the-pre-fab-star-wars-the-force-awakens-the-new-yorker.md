description: "For better and worse, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" is a work of directorial authorship. J. J. Abrams has long been channelling the spirit of Steven Spielberg, and here he splices the Spielbergian gene into George Lucas's mythology. That's not an inherently bad thing-if it's done by Steven Spielberg."
